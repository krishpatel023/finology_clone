            <h2>Journey of an investor.</h2>
            <p>People often get confused when it comes to understanding the stock market and<br> investing, and consider it as a gambling market. But little do they know that the<br> stock market, if understood & used correctly, can do wonders with your money!<br>Here's a clear guide to help you find the perfect path to begin your investing journey,<br> so that you can make the most out of the market.</p>

            <h2>Who should drink water? Who should eat food? Who should exercise?</h2>
            <p><strong>That's right. Everyone.</strong><br>Just like drinking water, eating food & staying fit are life's basic necessities, earning <br>& growing money is also equally important. Everyone wants to increase their net<br> worth, and wants to provide their family with a good life. And simply living from <br>paycheck to paycheck is hardly going to suffice that. Hence, not investing is not an <br>option. Just like you have to drink water to live, you have to invest to grow your<br> money. Irrespective of your age and monthly income, the right investing will <br>always bear full results and fruitful returns. So yes, anyone & everyone should<br> invest.</p>

            <h2>The sooner you start the better it is.</h2>
            <p>Going back to what we started with, there is no right time to start drinking water,<br> or eating food or exercise. You just do it whenever you feel thirsty, hungry or lazy. <br>Similarly, there is no right time to start investing. Anyone can start investing at any<br> age they want. The only thing that will differ will be the type of investment and its<br> allocation, based on your income, savings and spendings and of course, your <br>financial goals. A 12 year old will have different financial goals and risk taking<br> capacity as compared to a 42 year old. So, your age will impact your investing style<br> and not the when of when you should start investing.</p>

            <h2>After getting your monthly salary, do you just randomly<br> give all your money to anyone?</h2>
            <p>No! You've worked hard for that money and it's yours! Then why invest<br> your money in the market based on someone else's advice or tip? It's like <br>you're giving your hard earned money to a stranger to use it for something you <br>don't even understand! So, the first and foremost step to start investing is to <br>learn its basic concepts so that you can understand how the market works and <br>make well-informed decisions. But, the lengthy & boring financial courses that<br> are available in the market make this process dull. Here's where Quest by <br>Finology comes to your rescue! Learn investing & finance on the go with <br>Quest's action-packed, practical courses which are adjustable to your <br>attention span.</p>

            <h2>Does simply knowing how a plane flies make you a pilot?</h2>
            <p>Of course not! Then how can you expect this with investing? Investing<br> requires practice, so the next step after learning concepts is to align what<br> you've learnt with the real world. Before actually investing, witness the market<br> in action and analyse a few stocks with the right information & data.<br> Unfortunately, that's what's missing from today's equity research tools, where<br> the data is often inaccurate. Ticker by Finolgy is specially designed to solve<br> this problem by providing a vast data bank of all the listed companies. The <br>best part? Ticker is completely technology-backed so that you can make<br> accurate analyses and choose only the best stocks.</p>

            <h2>Umm, not yet. Knowing how the market works is still not enough to begin investing.</h2>
            <p>You still don't know how much risk you can take, and how much money<br> you should allocate in stocks, bonds or mutual funds. For this, you will <br>need the perfect financial plan for yourself. But modern-day financial advisors<br> deliver you biased & generalised investment plans for insanely high charges.<br> Recipe by Finology brings an end to this by giving you the power to manage<br> your money according to your personal goals. It creates the perfect financial<br> plan for you by first assessing your current financial position and then <br>suggesting the best plans of action to meet your personal financial goals, so <br>that you can plan on growing your wealth, instead of just your income.</p>
